# KMS Coding Guidelines

_Style is an often overlooked but very critical attribute of writing. The style of writing directly impacts the readability and understandability of the end product_ ([*](http://www.adaic.org/resources/add_content/docs/95style/95style.pdf))

The readability and understandability of source code are important not only for the creation of quality software products but also in creating software products that can be developed on schedule and within cost.

This document holds all coding standards and best practices that are using in KMS software projects and high-recommended to use for new development projects. We believe that applying strictly coding styles, using solid coding techniques and good programming practices in software development is a key point in software quality, performance, and maintenance.

The KMS coding conventions and best practices are compiled not only from KMS developers own experiences, but also from standard guidelines provided by technology owners (Oracle, Microsoft, Google, Facebook...) and well-known organizations are accepted by large communities.

You can find the coding guidelines for a specific technology in the list as below:

* [Java](java.md)
* [.NET with C#](dotnet.md)
* [JavaScript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/blob/master/README.md) (from airbnb.io)
* [Web Front-end](web-front-end.md)
* [Swift](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide) (from raywenderlich.com)
* [Objective-C](https://github.com/raywenderlich/objective-c-style-guide) (from raywenderlich.com)
* [Android](https://github.com/ribot/android-guidelines/blob/master/project_and_code_guidelines.md) (from ribot.co.uk)

* [ETL](etl/README.md)
* [SQL Server](sql-server.md)

* [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/style-guide.html) (from groovy-lang.org)

As supporting for software development process, KMS provide the standards for:
